## About MilesReport

Miles report is a web application for people who need to track where they have been for tax or business reasons.This program allows to add set locations and select between them. Google's Distance Matrix API (a requirement) takes care of measuring the distance.

### Why was this made?
This project was made because I travel for work between offices a lot. And the place I work for requires a location to location, mile by mile sheet to comp me. This project was made to make keeping track of it and sending the sheet much much easier.

### Current Features
* Add Locations (Manually in database)
* Log entries
* Automatic report email on schedule (default every 30 days)
* User Authentication
* API (WIP)
